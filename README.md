# CommonPHP Libraries

The inception of this project was aimed at developing a comprehensive framework for public use under the MIT license. Although its essence remains, the project's objective has evolved.

Currently, this library serves as a personal repository for Packagist, facilitating projects that incorporate these varied libraries. As an individual developer, the constraints of time and resources prevent me from maintaining a project aimed at broad public engagement. Nonetheless, this work is not concealed; it is available for anyone who might find it beneficial. There are, without doubt, more refined libraries available, but this does not diminish the value that these might offer.

These libraries are open for use, with the stipulation that licensing information is preserved. While issue reporting and contributions are welcome, I must advise that my ability to respond may be limited, and updates to this library may not occur regularly.

## Notes on Documentation

Documenting a public library poses a significant challenge for me, primarily due to my struggle with articulating the operational intricacies of these libraries. To address this, I rely on AI, specifically OpenAI, to generate documentation. This approach ensures that while the code is authored by me, the documentation is both a personal reference and, potentially, a resource for public use.

Contributions towards enhancing the documentation are highly appreciated.

## Reporting Issues

Should you encounter any problems within a library, you are encouraged to report them through the issues tab of the respective library, including details for replicating the issue.
